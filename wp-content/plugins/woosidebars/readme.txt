WooSidebars adds functionality to display different widgets in a sidebar, according to a context (for example, a specific page or a category).

== Description ==

With WooSidebars, it's possible to change the widgets that display in a sidebar (widgetized area) according to a context (for example, a specific page, a specific blog post, certain categories or the search results screen). With WooSidebars, setting up a custom widget area to display across multiple conditions is as easy as a few clicks.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.3 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooSidebars, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New. 

In the search field type "WooSidebars" and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our widget areas plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking Install Now. After clicking that link you will be asked if you’re sure you want to install the plugin. Click yes and WordPress will automatically complete the installation. 

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our widget areas plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application.

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation’s wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

= Where to go after installation =

Once WooSidebars has been installed and activated, please visit the "Appearance -> Widget Areas" screen to begin adding custom widget areas.

Automatic updates should work a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
